I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the interdisciplinary [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell) from the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics. Previously, I earned my M.S. in the same major under the joint supervision of [Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/) and [Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/), focusing on WiFi networks, mobility data, and Covid-19 models. I also completed internships at [Tesla](https://tesla.com/), working on the networking planning of superchargers, and at [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), working on large-scale representative thermodynamic models. I will join [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) as an Applied Scientist Intern in the summer 2025. 

My academic background includes studies in Economics and Mathematics, leading to the attainment of my BS from Presbyterian College, SC, United States.

A key focus of my Ph.D. research is the study of social, physical, and pathological dynamics which can be understood as networks and perturbations. These networks can represent diverse connections, including those that are online, sparse, or expensive to approximate and maintain. I am particularly interested in exploring whether it is possible to reverse-engineer a such model in order to complete the networks, re-establish their progression, or generate new data. This area of research continues to be a significant focus of my Ph.D. program.

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, a reader, and an audience of musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
