I am an incoming senior machine learning engineer of *[Tesla](https://tesla.com/)*, Relaibility Engineering, starting early 2026.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the interdisciplinary *[Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/)* program at Georgia Tech, advised by *[Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell)* in the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics. I previously earned my M.S. in the same program under the joint supervision of *[Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/)* and *[Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/)*, focusing on WiFi networks, mobility data, and COVID-19 modeling. I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Presbyterian College (South Carolina, USA). During my Ph.D., I interned at *[Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/)*, *[Tesla](https://tesla.com/)*, and *[Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/)*.

### Research Interests

A central theme of my research is bridging modern generative models with physical or network systems under perturbations. Examples include the pathology dynamics of diseases, logistics networks, and human mobility. Recently, I have been exploring generative diffusion/flow models, stochastic optimal control, and network science.

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, reader, and enthusiastic audience member of musicals, sports, and concerts (🖤🩷).
