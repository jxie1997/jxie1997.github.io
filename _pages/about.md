I am a Ph.D. candidate in the interdisciplinary *[Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/)* program at Georgia Tech, advised by *[Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell)* in the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics. I previously earned my M.S. in the same program under the joint supervision of *[Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/)* and *[Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/)*, focusing on WiFi networks, mobility data, and COVID-19 modeling. I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Presbyterian College (South Carolina, USA). During my Ph.D., I interned at *[Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/)*, *[Tesla](https://tesla.com/)*, and *[Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/)*.

### Research Interests

A central theme of my research is bridging modern generative models with physical or network systems under perturbations. Examples include the pathology dynamics of diseases, logistics networks, and human mobility. Recently, I have been exploring generative diffusion/flow models, stochastic optimal control, and network science.

### Selected Research Areas & Projects

**Bio-mechanistic Generative Models**
- Variational autoencoderâ€“style approaches for generating brain connectomes under neurological diseases ([*International Journal of Molecular Sciences* 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/3/1062)).
- Dynamic Brain Connectome Vulnerability in Neurodegeneration via Score-based Network Diffusion *(coming soon!)*.
- Diffusion Bridge Sampler and Stochastic Optimal Control *(title removed for review anonymization)*.

**Additional Work**
- Source-robust, non-parametric reconstruction of epidemic-like event-based network diffusion processes with online data *(submitted to PLOS Computational Biology)*.  
- Augmenting Bayesian topic models using online confirmations from community-driven apps ([*BuildSys* 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3600100.3626341)).  
- Representative deep-gray thermodynamic models of residential buildings ([*Energy & Buildings* 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778824005243)).  
- Empirical WiFi datasets for localizing COVID-19 interventions ([*Frontiers in Digital Health* 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1060828/full)).

Outside of research, I am a dreamer, reader, and enthusiastic audience member of musicals, sports, and concerts (ðŸ–¤ðŸ©·).
