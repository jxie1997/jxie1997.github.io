I am a Ph.D. candidate in the interdisciplinary [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Cassie S. Mitchell](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Cassie-S.-Mitchell) in the Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics. I previously earned my M.S. in the same program under the joint supervision of [Prof. B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/) and [Prof. Lauren N. Steimle](https://sites.gatech.edu/steimle/), focusing on WiFi networks, mobility data, and COVID-19 modeling.  

I hold a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics from Presbyterian College (South Carolina, USA).

### Experience

**Applied Scientist Intern** â€“ [Amazon AMXL](https://www.amazon.science/) *(Summer 2025)*  
<!-- - Developed and deployed a neural latent ODE model for station-level delivery forecasts with uncertainty
  quantification on attainment rates.
- Evaluated the model on all week+1 forecasts datasets, outperforming baseline model by 8 out of 9 parcel
  types and estimated to save $7M on operational costs over 6 months for AMXL networks.
- Productionized the pipeline via AWS Step Functions with EC2 Batch, adopted by the Demand Planning Team. -->

**Data Scientist Intern** â€“ [Tesla](https://tesla.com/) *(Fall 2023)*  
  <!-- - Built weekday-matching logic for energy demand shift modeling, improving holiday forecast accuracy by 30%.
  - Created a changepoint detection method using Fisher ratio and AUC-based thresholding, improving precision
    by 10%. -->

**Research Intern** â€“ [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) *(Summer 2023)*  
<!-- - Designed **representative thermodynamic models** using meta-learning for residential buildings.  
- Enabled scalable simulations for energy efficiency and grid-interactive control. -->

### Research Interests

A central theme of my research is understanding **social, physical, and pathological dynamics** as networked systems subject to perturbations. My work asks:  

> *Can we reverse-engineer, fine-tune, or control base systems to recover missing connections, reconstruct their evolution, or generate plausible new data?*  

To address this, my Ph.D. work integrates **optimal control, generative modeling, and physics-informed learning** to model and intervene in complex dynamical systems.
